## An unintuitive truth

There would be little to no arguing if one were to sum up the story of humanity as a quest for truth.
But before attempting to unravel the complex mysteries of the world, one should first try to come up with the appropriate framework in order to decipher these mysteries in a reliable and sustainable way.
A great amount of methods have been tested, but building scientific theories has withstood the test of time, and currently forms the backbone of science. No progress in science can be acknowledged without it, as theories allow us to generalize truth and knowledge, explain new phenomenons and even predict new events.

An even greater insight has been discovered during the 20th Century by Karl Popper. This philosopher stated that scientists should not simply try to find confirmations for their theories, but should rather try make them falsifiable [1].

This rather unintuitive truth has found quite a lot of opponents during the years, but has proven to be nonetheless a very effective way of deciphering fake science from real science.

This can be explained by the fact that confirmations are very easy to find for a scientific theory (you could just look for them). Some even try building science *around* confirmations of their theories. But a more challenging way would be to find prohibitions for them.
In other words, we should need to find out what could not happen within the framework of our own theories.

We can then end up with theories that can be disproven by any experiment (or random event for the matter), making them all the strongest and easiest to defend against potential deniers.

## Challenges on the way

While Karl's theory of falsifiability has proven to be extremely useful to decipher potential fake scientific theories, it has found some challenges in new kinds of theories that couldn't practically be falsified.

A first example comes from String Theory, which is a theory attempting to describe and explain the different physical properties of the world in a single and unified way. The issue comes from the fact that the theory deals in such tiny scales of matter that it could not be falsified in an easy manner.

Other cases include also the science of behaviorism in psychology. While new theories in this field try to confirm human behaviors, they seldom try to falsify other behaviors (a much harder feat, since humans are capable of doing nearly anything...)[2].

We can either acknowledge these new theories as good attempts in explaining the physics of the world or the complex behaviors of human beings, or treat them as non-science since they fail the falsifiability criterion.[3]

## Conclusion

The falsifiability test has been used to *make or break* science in the past, but recent advances in a diverse set of fields have challenged this fact. We're tempted to call these new theories as science while we wait for new ways to prove them to be falsifiable.
Purists may be astonished of this fact, since we shouldn't even treat these theories as scientific ones, but one should not be so impatient.
The world, like the heart, may have reasons that even reason cannot know.
