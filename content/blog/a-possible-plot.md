## A Possible Plot
You started from scratch, and became successful at a very early age. You climbed every obstacle that came your way. You are ambitious, and you stop at nothing.

A merciless war is being waged against you. But you don't care. You persevere. You rely only on yourself, and you don't give up.

You adapt to any circumstance. You are flexible. You are agile. Each new day, you have only one goal: to become a better version of yourself.

You are demanding and you know what you want. Facts and figures oriented, you are rational and logical.

You defy current codes, reverse roles. You are not afraid to break old trends and fashions.


You're making us go through a pretty bad year, but then why, dear virus, can I only find you good qualities?

I have the feeling that you want to tell us something. But we are not listening to you. Because we don't know what to tell you.

Your existence may be temporary. But you won't disappear as long as your qualities continue to please us. For now, you are a perfect reflection of our imperfect era. And your silence is proof that we still have a lot of work to do.

On our calendars, having still several of those, holidays remind me of our past wars, or current borders. But the day we defeat you, there will be 7 billion of us celebrating the first day of a new era.

Many years later, our children will learn about our history.

*They will ask us in amazement: "Why did we have to go through this to realize we are united ? Â».*
