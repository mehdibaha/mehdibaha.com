I'm a software engineer looking to complete this year an Exchange Semester in Machine Learning at KTH Stockholm.

It's been 2 weeks since I've moved here in Sweden, and since I'm in a new city + in a new school, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to start a new website.

Other than general info about me, this new site will mainly function as a blog, where I will share thoughts about stuff I find interesting: like tech, startups, AI and philosophy.

It's with great excitement that I'm starting this new site. I have already a list of planned articles I want to write, I can't wait to bring them to light!
